<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# üìñ [Protfolic] <a name="about-project"></a>


A mobile version skeleton refers to the basic structure and layout of a web page specifically designed for mobile devices. HTML and CSS are used to create this skeleton.

In HTML, you would define the necessary elements such as the `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`and so on. These elements provide the structural organization of the page. Additionally, you would use appropriate HTML tags to mark up content like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

CSS is then employed to style and arrange these elements for mobile devices. This includes setting the width and height of the page, adjusting the font sizes, applying responsive design techniques to ensure proper scaling and positioning on different screen sizes, and optimizing the layout for touch interactions.

By combining HTML and CSS, you can create a mobile version skeleton that provides a clear and user-friendly layout for mobile devices, allowing your website to be easily accessed and navigated on smartphones and tablets.
